        <p>I gradudated college with a degree in exercise science.
            I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my life, but I knew I wanted to leave
            my hometown, so I moved to Atlanta. In Atlanta, I found a job as a CrossFit
            coach. I had a lot of fun doing that, but knew it wasn't my lifelong career.

        <p>Once I realized I didn't want to coach anymore I began looking for 
            alternative career paths. I initially looked to become a therapist, but 
            it turns out getting into graduate school was harder than I thought. 
            From there, with the help of some friends, I decided to begin coding and
            began to explore the wonderful world of talking to computers.

        <p>Once I settled on that I worked at it on my own for a few months 
            until I knew this was going to be the next adventure for me. 
            I then signed up for DigitalCrafts bootcamp and now here I am making
            websites like this one.. which are.. something.
