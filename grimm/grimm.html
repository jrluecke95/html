        <h3>Part 1</h3>
        <p><strong>A poor man had so many children that he had already asked
            everyone in the world to be godfather, and when still another
            child was born, no one else was left whom he could invite.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            He knew not what to do, and, in his perplexity, he lay down
            and fell asleep.  Then he dreamt that he was to go outside the
            gate, and ask the first person he met to be godfather.  When he awoke,
            he determined to obey his dream, and went outside the gate, and
            asked the first person who came up to him to be godfather.  The
            stranger presented him with a little glass of water, and said,
            this is a wonderful water, with it you can heal the sick, only
            you must see where death is standing.  If he is standing by the
            patient's head, give the patient some of the water and he will
            be healed, but if death is standing by his feet, all trouble
            will be in vain, for the sick man must die.  From this time forth,
            the man could always say whether a patient could be saved or
            not, and became famous for his skill, and earned a great deal
            of money.  Once he was called in to the child of the king, and
            when he entered, he saw death standing by the child's head and
            cured it with the water, and he did the same a second time, but
            the third time death was standing by its feet, and then he knew
            the child had to die.

                    Once the man thought he would visit the godfather, and tell him
                    how he had succeeded with the water.  But when he entered the
                    house, the strangest things were going on within.

                <p>On the first
                    flight of stairs, the broom and shovel were disputing, and
                    knocking each other about violently.  He asked them, where does
                    the godfather live.  The broom replied, one flight of stairs
                    higher up.

                    dead fingers lying.  He asked, where does the godfather live.
                    One of the fingers replied, one flight of stairs higher.

                    On
                    the third flight lay a heap of dead heads, which again directed
                    him to the flight beyond.

                    On the fourth flight, he saw fishes on
                    the fire, which frizzled in pans and baked themselves.  They,
                    too, said, one flight of stairs higher.

                    And when he had
                    ascended the fifth, he came to the door of a room and peeped
                    through the keyhole, and there he saw the godfather who had
                    a pair of long horns.

            When he opened the door and went in,
        the godfather got into bed in a great hurry and covered himself
        up.  Then said the man, sir godfather, what a strange house-hold
        you have.  When I came to your first flight of stairs, the shovel
        and broom were quarreling, and beating each other violently.
        How stupid you are, said the godfather.  That was the boy
        and the maid talking to each other.  But on the second flight I
        saw dead fingers lying.  Oh, how silly you are.  Those were some
        roots of scorzonera.  On the third flight lay a heap of dead
        men's heads.  Foolish man, those were cabbages.  On the fourth
        flight I saw fishes in a pan, which were hissing and baking
        themselves.  When he had said that, the fishes came and served
        themselves up.

            you and you had <strong><em>long, long horns.</em></strong>  Oh, that is not true.  The
            man became alarmed, and ran out, and if he had not, who knows
            what the godfather would have done to him.
