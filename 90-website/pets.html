        <p>We adopted Lulu a week ago and have been in love ever since
            She's very well behaved and knows her basic commands.
            She's also a very big snuggler and demands to be the 
            front and center of the party whenever possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are very excited to get to know her more.
            Everday she comes out of her shell a little more.
            She's starting to wag her tail more, play in the 
            backyard, and eat all of her food!
        </p>
        <p>We need to train her some more and make sure 
            she knows that we are the people she needs to pay 
            attention to the most, but she's very smart, so we are
            confident that when we begin training, she'll do well.
