    <p>This exercise is about making lists</p>
    <p>Here's what i like about lists</p>
    <ul>
        <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
        <li>That's about it</li>
        <li>I'mm gunna put another list item here bcause doing things in threes is cool</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you make a list, do it in this order:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
        <Li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</Li>
            <ul>
                <li>use li tags nested in the list for your list items</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li>
                </ol>
